      <description>IntroductionSometimes, just having a chart isn’t enough. When working on the web, interactivity is key to capturing a user’s interest and attention. One simple way of doing so, is by adding a tooltip or hover effect to the data points. Not only is this great for the user’s attention, it helps with the readability of the data as well.
Basic ExampleWe are introducing a new library called ggiraph.</description>

      <title>Using ggplot - Time Series</title>

      <description>IntroductionA new chart to introduce is called a time series. This type is used when you want to visualize data along a period of time. The x-axis represents the time and the y-axis represents the data. This is a subset of the line graph, as a line graph doesn’t have a precondition of the x-axis representing time.
Basic ExampleFor this example we will use the number of home runs that Babe Ruth during his career.</description>

      <description>IntroductionA bar plot uses rectangular bars (like a histogram) to represent data that is grouped into a series, sized accordingly based on the numerical value associated with it. The rectangular bars can be displayed either vertically or horizontally.
Basic ExampleFirst, we must gather our data. For this example, we will gather the number of home runs a team hit in 1980. For this purpose, we are ordering the results by the number of home runs hit.</description>

      <title>Lahman database using dplyr</title>

      <guid>http://ronrichardson.netlify.com/post/lahman-database-using-dplyr/</guid>
      <description>IntroductionThe Lahman database is a publically accessible database of baseball statistics. This database contains multiple tables of data from a large time series, which makes it great to run experiments against.
dplyr is an R package which allows programmatic access to this data using concepts very similar to T-SQL.
InitializationsOnce the packages are installed, they need to be loaded into the environemnt. This is accomplished with two lines of code.</description>
