Another great way to visualize data is by using a histogram.  A histogram is very simple to do.

```{r}
library(Lahman)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

df<-Master %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  select(weight)

ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(data=df,aes(x=weight), color="white", fill="blue", bins=25) + 
  ggtitle("Baseball player weights")

```
