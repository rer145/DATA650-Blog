<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="/post/creating-a-wordcloud/">Wordclouds</a> are great tools to quickly see the words used in a piece of text, but they can get boring to look at. In this post, we introduce a new R package called wordcloud2. This package will dynamically plot the wordcloud on screen, add hoverability to each word, and be able to form the wordcloud into different shapes.</p>
</div>
<div id="getting-our-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Getting our Data</h2>
<p>Once again, we will use the text from Bram Stoker’s “Dracula”. For a more indepth explanation of how we get this data, please see the post <a href="/post/simple-sentiment-analysis/">“Simple Sentiment Analysis”</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(gutenbergr)
library(tidytext)
library(dplyr)
library(wordcloud2)

dracula&lt;-gutenberg_download(345)
dracula$gutenberg_id&lt;-NULL

dracula&lt;-dracula%&gt;%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)

bing&lt;-get_sentiments(&#39;bing&#39;)
dracula&lt;-inner_join(dracula, bing)</code></pre>
<p>We also need to count up the number of occurrences of each word in the text, using dplyr.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>words&lt;-dracula%&gt;%
  group_by(word)%&gt;%
  summarize(count=n())%&gt;%
  arrange(count)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="using-wordcloud2" class="section level2">
<h2>Using wordcloud2</h2>
<p>Wordcloud2 has several options for how to shape the wordcloud. The available shapes are: * circle * cardioid * diamond * triangle * triangle-forward * pentagon * star</p>
<p>For this example, we will make a triangle of the words, and also change the background color to be black.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>wordcloud2(words, shape=&#39;triangle&#39;, backgroundColor=&#39;black&#39;)</code></pre>

<p>Another fun way to use wordcloud2 is to plot the wordcloud using an image of any shape. The image must have a clear delineation between light and dark colors. Here, we have a simple image of a bat, which we can pass to wordcloud2 and its shape will resemble our image.</p>
