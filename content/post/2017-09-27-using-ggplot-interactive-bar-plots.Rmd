## Introduction

Sometimes, just having a chart isn't enough. When working on the web, interactivity is key to capturing a user's interest and attention.  One simple way of doing so, is by adding a tooltip or hover effect to the data points.  Not only is this great for the user's attention, it helps with the readability of the data as well.

## Basic Example

We are introducing a new library called ggiraph. This adds the interactive versions of the ggplot charts.  All charts are suffixed with '_interactive'.

One thing to note is the addition of 'tooltip-HR,data_id=name' to the aes(). This lets ggiraph know that HR is the value to display, and the unique value that the series is grouped by is name. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#import libraries
library(Lahman)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggiraph)

#store data into a variable named df
df<-Teams %>%
  filter(yearID == 1980) %>%
  select(name, HR) %>%
  arrange(HR)

#update field to be a factor, not chr
df$name<-factor(df$name, levels=df$name)

#Store the plot into a variable
g<-ggplot()+
  geom_bar_interactive(data=df,aes(x=name,y=HR,tooltip=HR,data_id=name), stat="identity", color="blue", fill="white")+
  ggtitle("HR by team in 1980 with ggiraph")+
  coord_flip()+
  ylab("Homeruns")+
  xlab("Team")

#display graph using ggiraph
ggiraph(code=print(g),hover_css="fill:blue; stroke:white")
```
